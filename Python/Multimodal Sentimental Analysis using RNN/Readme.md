### Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis with Novel RNN Architecture

Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is poised to revolutionize sentiment analysis by leveraging complementary data streams such as vocal and facial expressions in addition to textual content. With the advent of deep learning techniques, MSA has gained traction among researchers and practitioners alike. In this paper, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for multi-modal sentiment analysis, integrating video, audio, and text modalities. Our approach aims to capture affective traces present in vocal and facial displays alongside textual content, offering promising avenues for deeper sentiment understanding.

#### Dataset:
We utilize the CMU-MOSI dataset, which provides multi-modal data including video, audio, and text transcripts. This dataset offers a diverse range of sentiment expressions captured across various contexts, making it suitable for training and evaluating our proposed model.

#### Proposed Methodology:
We propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture tailored for multi-modal sentiment analysis. Our model integrates video, audio, and text modalities, extracting features from each modality and fusing them to capture holistic sentiment representations. The architecture is designed to exploit temporal dependencies and spatial correlations present in multi-modal data, facilitating robust sentiment analysis across modalities.

#### Results and Discussion:
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RNN architecture outperforms existing methods in multi-modal sentiment analysis tasks. By leveraging complementary information from video, audio, and text modalities, our model achieves superior sentiment prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities.

#### Conclusion:
In this system, we present a novel approach to multi-modal sentiment analysis based on RNN architecture. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging multiple modalities for sentiment analysis, paving the way for deeper emotional understanding in text, audio, and video data. We believe that our proposed methodology holds promise for various applications, including affective computing, sentiment-aware systems, and human-computer interaction.
