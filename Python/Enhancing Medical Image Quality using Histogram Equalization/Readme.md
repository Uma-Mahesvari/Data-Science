## Enhancing Medical Image Quality using Histogram Equalization

### Overview
This project focuses on improving the quality of medical images through histogram equalization techniques. Medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, often suffer from poor contrast and visibility, which can impact diagnostic accuracy. Histogram equalization is a widely used method to enhance image contrast by redistributing pixel intensities.

### Goals
- Enhance the visual quality of medical images to aid in accurate diagnosis.
- Improve contrast and visibility of anatomical structures.
- Develop a robust and efficient algorithm suitable for medical imaging applications.
  
### Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Gather a diverse dataset of medical images from various modalities, including X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the images to remove noise and artifacts that may interfere with the enhancement process.
3. **Histogram Equalization**: Implement histogram equalization techniques to adjust the intensity distribution of the images, thereby improving contrast and visibility.
  
### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Google Colab Notebook for interactive development and visualization
  
### Expected Outcome
- Enhanced medical images with improved contrast and visibility.
- Validation through quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluation by medical experts.
- Potential integration into medical imaging systems for routine clinical use.
